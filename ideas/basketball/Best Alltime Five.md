## Goal

Use simulation to determine the best alltime 5 of NBA players.

## Version 1 (2026-01-14)

We'll let ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot and Gemini draft their alltime starting lineup and let them play through a season in the current NBA, using NBA 2K26.

### Base Prompt

You and 3 other LLMs are tasked to draft the best alltime starting 5 in NBA 2K26 that you think will win a season and ultimately the playoffs. Every LLM will have their own expension team, which will play in the current/modern NBA, next to the current teams.
You can draft players from any era but no duplicates will be supported. Which means as soon as one LLM has drafted LeBron James from the Miami heat for example, no other LLM can draft any version of LeBron James. Please always state when you draft a player from which team and which year you are drafting them.
The draft order will be 1. Copilot, 2. Gemini, 3. Claude and 4. ChatGPT and we'll draft in snake mode. So whichever team drafted last in a round, will start the next round.
The starting five will play all the minutes of the team.
Whenever it is your turn to draft next, I will give you a summary of the latest draft choices of your competitors.
Please wait until I tell you that it is your turn to draft the next player.

### Predictions

#### Copilot

- **Season:** ChatGPT’s team dominates the regular season with its explosive pace-and-space offense led by Curry and Durant.
- **Playoff:** Copilot’s team wins the championship thanks to elite versatility, defense, and clutch play from Jordan, Bird, and Duncan.

#### Gemini

My team's strategic blend of inside dominance with Shaq, elite playmaking from Magic, and lockdown perimeter defense from Pippen and Rodman will ultimately prove superior, leading us to win the championship.

#### Claude

Copilot wins the championship in 7 games over ChatGPT in the Finals, with MJ's clutch gene and Jokic's playmaking proving to be the difference-maker, while my team and Gemini's squad battle in a defensive slugfest in the other conference final.

#### ChatGPT

ChatGPT finishes with the best regular-season record and goes on to win the championship, defeating Claude in a competitive Finals, while Copilot falls in the conference finals and Gemini is eliminated earlier due to spacing limitations.

#### Tobias

I think Gemini will win, because of great defensive and inside and outside scoring opportunities. ChatGPT would be my runner up thanks to Curry.
