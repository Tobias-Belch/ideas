# Monitor Riser Speakers – Concept Summary

import SpeakerViewer from '@pocs/3d-speaker-viewer/Viewer'

## Background

The project started with a **[custom monitor riser](https://tobias-belch.github.io/ideas/docs/monitor-riser/aorus-fv43u-monitor-riser/)** design for a large display (AORUS FV43U).  
While structurally sound, the resulting risers were **bulky** and consumed a significant amount of desk space.

To compensate and add value, the idea evolved into turning the risers into **fully functional desk speakers**.

## Core Idea

Transform each monitor riser into a **stereo speaker enclosure**, creating:

- A **space-efficient audio solution**
- Proper speaker placement for near-field listening
- A multi-functional piece of desk furniture

Each riser becomes part of a **left/right stereo pair**, with one acting as a *master* (electronics) and the other as a *slave* (speaker only).

## Target Dimensions

Per riser (external):

- **Width (X):** 15 cm  
- **Height (Y):** 19 cm  
- **Depth (Z):** 30 cm  

These dimensions provide approximately **8-9 liters of internal acoustic volume**, which is very suitable for compact desktop speakers.

## Feasibility Assessment

### DIY vs Off-the-Shelf

- Existing commercial speakers do **not fit the dimensions well**
- DIY is **not only possible, but preferable**
- All required electronics exist as **off-the-shelf modules**

### Functional Requirements

The speaker system supports:

- 3.5 mm analog audio input
- Bluetooth audio
- Stereo amplification
- Optional headphone output with speaker muting
- Front-accessible controls

No custom PCBs or DSP are required.

## Acoustic Concept

Two viable acoustic approaches were identified:

### Option 1 – Full-Range Driver (Simpler)
- One 3–4″ full-range driver per riser
- No crossover required
- Clean, coherent sound for desk use

### Option 2 – 2-Way Speaker (Higher Performance)
- 4″ woofer + tweeter
- Passive crossover
- Better clarity and stereo imaging

Both options fit well within the available enclosure volume.

## Enclosure Design Principles

- **Front-firing driver and bass port**
- Optimised for near-wall and desk placement
- Internally braced to handle:
  - Acoustic pressure
  - Monitor weight
- Acoustic damping inside the enclosure
- Electronics isolated from the speaker air volume

## Electronics Architecture

### Recommended Setup

- **Active speaker system**
- One riser contains:
  - Bluetooth + DAC + amplifier board
  - Volume control
  - Headphone jack
  - Status LED
- Second riser is passive, connected via speaker cable

Common amplifier solutions:
- Class-D modules (e.g. TPA3116 / TPA3118 based)

## Internal Layout (Final Concept)

### Coordinate System

- **X:** Width (left ↔ right)
- **Y:** Height (upwards)
- **Z:** Depth (backwards)

### Internal Zoning

- **Front / Bottom:** Speaker driver
- **Front / Bottom:** Bass reflex port
- **Middle:** Horizontal load-bearing brace
- **Rear / Top:** Electronics compartment

This layout aligns structural, acoustic, and usability requirements.

## Key Outcomes

- The concept is **technically sound and buildable**
- DIY speakers are the **best solution** for the given constraints
- The risers become a **coherent product**, not a compromise
- The design scales toward:
  - Detailed CAD
  - Acoustic tuning
  - A potential product or open design

## Suggested Next Steps

- Lock driver choice (full-range vs 2-way)
- Tune enclosure volume and port dimensions
- Define exact electronics BOM
- Add wall thickness, fasteners, and service panels
- Convert concept into a manufacturing-ready CAD model
